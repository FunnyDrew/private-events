## Project: Private Events

We want to build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite]() which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

* A user can create events. 
* A user can attend many events. 
* An event can be attended by many users. 
* Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
